Thus, to infer \"green\", an RNN doesn't need to rely on long-term dependency. A short-term memory is enough to make this inference possible.

    "### The Exploding Gradient Problem\n",
    "The exploding gradient problem is more common in RNNs. Due to large gradients, the weight updates are larger. As a consequence, the Backpropagation algorithm would diverge. Luckily it has an easy fix. We can monitor the gradients (e.g., via TensorBoard). If these get larger, we will see NaN values and eventually the program will crash. So, identifying gradient explosion is not too difficult. Once we identify it, we can resolve this issue by a technique called **gradient clipping**, which truncates the gradients at a pre-defined threshold. We will discuss this technique shortly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Vanishing Gradient Problem\n",
    "We should be more concerned about the vanishing gradient problem. Because it's not obvious when it occurs. Also, it has a deleterious effect on the learning in RNNs. Either due to the < 1 norm of $\\pmb{W}_{hh}$ or due to the < 1 value of the derivative of the activation, the weights in the lower layers stop getting updated. As a consequence, RNN fails to use the earlier states for inferring later states. In other words, when the vanishing gradient problem happens, RNNs lose long-range memory. What it is left with is only short-term memory. It makes inference based only on the recent past states. For problems that require the RNN to use longer dependency, it performs poorly. Thus, absence of long-term dependency in RNNs is a direct consequence of the vanishing gradient problem. We will discuss two key techniques to resolve the vanishing gradient problem.\n",

First, we zero-center and normalize the mini-batch input for each feature, as shown below. Then, we scale and shift the input.

    "\n",
    "One good heuristic for setting the threshold is to look at statistics on the average norm over a sufficiently large number of updates. It was shown based on empirical observation that values from half to ten times this average can still yield convergence. However, convergence speed can be affected.\n"

    "## Identity Initialization with ReLU Activation (for Resolving Vanishing Gradient)\n",

    "Previously we argued that ReLU causes the hidden state output to grow, which increases the loss gradients causing gradient explosion. But ReLU has one magical advantage, i.e., it constant 1 derivative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus ReLU could be very useful to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem as it never causes saturation. If we could ensure that the weight initializer will not increase the variance of the signals, then ReLU could be a boon.\n",

    "To ensure that the variance of the hidden state $\\vec{h}_t$ does not increase, we could initialize the recurrent weight matrix $\\pmb{W}_{hh}$ as an identity matrix (biases are initialized with zeros). \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, each new hidden state vector $\\vec{h}_t$ is obtained by **simply copying the previous hidden vector** $\\vec{h}_{t-1}$, adding on the effect of the current inputs and replacing all negative states by zero.\n",

    "In the absence of input, an RNN that is composed of ReLUs and initialized with the identity matrix just stays in the same state indefinitely.\n",
