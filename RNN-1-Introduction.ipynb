    "# Recurrent Neural Network: Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "To motivate the RNN architecture let's consider an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to perform sentiment analysis on a movie review dataset. There are two types of reviews in the dataset: positive and negative. We want to build a classifier to perform binary classification on this dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have studied two types of **feedforward MLP** classifiers:\n",
    "- Fully-connected (FC) Neural Network \n",
    "- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\n",
    "\n",
    "These two classifier models require the entire input data at each step of the training. Usually the input data is a sequence of numbers that are arranged:\n",
    "- As a 2D or 3D matrix (e.g., image) or\n",
    "- As 1D vector (e.g., sequence of words in a sentence). \n",
    "\n",
    "Irrespective of the type of the data, we have to feed the entire sequence as a single data point to the above classifiers. Let's solve the above sentiment classification problem using a FC network or CNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "- But what would be the input to the classifier?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the image classification problem, input in text classification is \n",
    "- Not numeric \n",
    "- Not of fixed length\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's illustrate the nature of the text input using a simple example. Say that we have only 6 reviews in our dataset along with the respective sentiment tags:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fellini created magic in Eight-and-Half! (POSITIVE)\n",
    "2. Disgusting! (NEGATIVE)\n",
    "3. The longest bore on celluloid! (NEGATIVE)\n",
    "4. I can watch Roma forever! (POSITIVE)\n",
    "5. Worst than the previous one! (NEGATIVE)\n",
    "6. Coppola's masterpiece! (POSITIVE)\n",
    "\n",
    "Observe that some samples (i.e., review) contain just one or two words. The largest review contains 5 words.\n",
    "\n",
    "To feed this dataset to a classifier, we need to perform preprocessing of the samples that include:\n",
    "- Map each word/phrase to a number\n",
    "- Transform each review into a fixed-length sequence of numbers (fixed-size vector)\n",
    "\n",
    "Mapping text tokens into numbers is known as **embedding**. There are various ways of creating text embedding. Let's not worry about this for now. Assume that for each token in the reviews, we have mapped them to a scalar number, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Coppola: [9.1]\n",
    "- Fellini: [8.4]\n",
    "- etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually the token embeddings are represented by a vector of numbers. For the sake of simplicity, we use a scalar number as embedding for each token. Using the embedding for each token, let's transform the reviews into numeric vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Review 1:\n",
    "\n",

    "Observe that after transformation, we have **variable-length vectors**, i. e., each review vector has different length. We cannot feed these vectors directly to the MLP classifier. To create fixed-length vectors, we may add padding of zero values to each review vector. Let's use the maximum length of a review in this dataset (i.e., length 5 in review 1) to determine the fixed length of an input vector. Then, add padding as necessary to ensure that each review vector has length 5. For example, now the second review is transformed as follows.\n",

    "\n",
    "Both of the above classifier models fall under the category of **feedforward neural network (FNN)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feedforward Neural Networks are not Effective for Text Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, FNNs are not useful for most text classification problems. There are a couple of reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variable length input \n",
    "\n",
    "In some domains such as text processing, the length of the input data varies. But the FNNs need fixed-sized vectors as input. Padding the input data with zeros is rather inefficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Variable length output \n",
    "\n",
    "For some applications, the output may not be a fixed-size vector. For example, in language translation the length of the output sentence may vary from the input sentence. FNNs can only produce a fixed-size output.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data has an inherent sequential structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Some type of data has a sequential/temporal structure. A good example is text data. Each word/phrase in a sentence is related to next word. So far, we assumed that our data points are independently and identically distributed. We created the models (e.g., FNNs) based on this assumption. However, this is not true for text data (it also applies to speech and video data). For example, it we permute the words in a review, it will be difficult to understand the semantic meaning of the complete review.\n",
    "\n",
    "The FNNs are not designed to handle sequential data well. Think about why CNNs are so powerful on image data. They are effective due to their ability to manipulate spatial structure of the image data. In a similar vein, if we want to design a powerful neural network model for text classification, we have to somehow be able to manipulate the temporal or sequential structure of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Constant amount of computation\n",
    "\n",
    "The FNN models have a fixed architecture, which is defined by the number of layers. As a consequence, these models can only perform a fixed amount of computational steps. The core reason that RNNs are more exciting, as we will see shortly, is that they allow us to operate over sequences of vectors: Sequences in the input, the output, or in the most general case both. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## An Effective Neural Network Architecture to Process Sequence Data\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture the sequential relationship between the words in a text, we can break down the input text (e.g., a review) into a sequence of tokens (words/phrases). Then, use each token as a single input to train the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a simple architecture for the new model, as shown below. It consists of a single neuron in the hidden layer. Say that we want to build a language model that will enable us to predict the next word based on previous sequence of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "At timestep $t_1$ this neuron takes an input (which is an embedding of the current word \"Fellini\"). For each token, the next token is its label.\n",
    "\n",
    "The neuron at $t_1$ computes a value for the next word \"created\" in the output. This value carries information of the first word. It is fed back to the input of the next timestep $t_2$ which also takes the next word \"created\" for processing. At the second timestep $t_2$ we have two input values: one value from the previous timestep carrying information about the past word, and the current word.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://engineering.unl.edu/images/uploads/RNN_1.png\" width=700, height=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "The above network is trained for a single sample (e.g., a single review) by repeatedly or recurrently feeding each token over time. The output of each learning step is fed into the input of the next step. As a consequence, output at any timestep is computed based on the input from all previous timesteps. For example, the output at timestep $t_4$ is computed based on the signals from $t_1$ to $t_4$.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Text Processing is About Creating Memories\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially what is happening in the above scenario is that the network is building some type of **memory** of the past words to infer the next word in the sequence. The middle layer in the figure (shown below) acts as a **memory state or hidden state** that stores past information. The past information is used together with the current input to determine the current output. \n",
    "\n",
    "This inference process is akin to our reading process. When we read a sentence, we don't read the entire text as a single unit. Instead we process the sentence token-by-token keeping memories of what we processed before. Biological intelligence processes information incrementally while **maintaining an internal model of what it’s processing**, built from past information and constantly updated as new information comes in.\n",

    "## A New Architecture for Processing Sequence Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The above illustration can be used to design a new type of neural network for processing sequence data such as text. There are three different layers in this architecture: input layer, hidden state layer, and the output layer, as shown below. We assume that the hidden state layer consists of only one neuron.\n",

    "The hidden state stores sequence information using a hidden state variable, denoted by $h$. The hidden state $h_t$ at timestep $t$ is computed by a FC layer based on the input $x_t$ at timestep $t$ and the hidden state information $h_{t-1}$ from previous timestep $t-1$: \n",

What is distinctive about this architecture is that its hidden state is fed into its input, creating a loop or cycle. This architecture is unlike previous neural networks, which don't have any loop. This cyclic architecture is known as **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the above figure (right), the RNN architecture is shown. The left figure is the same network that is unrolled through time. The same recurrent computation is represented once per timestep.

    "## RNN: Signal Propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's present how a signal is propagated forward in RNNs for a single sample. We need to be careful about the meaning of timestep in the context of RNNs. In a typical optimization algorithm, such as in gradient descent, we often refer iteration $t$ as time $t$. However, time in RNNs refers to **steps within an iteration**. \n",

    "\n",
    "In feedforward neural networks (FC or CNN), the depth of a network is defined in **space**, i.e., with respect to the number of hidden layers. More fundamentally, the network depth represents the length of the path that an input signal has to pass through to reach the final state in the computation. In FNNs, this length is defined by the depth of a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in RNNs, a signal propagates through time to reach the final state via recurrence. Thus, the amount of the recurrence is a measure of the depth of a RNN. In other words, in RNNs the network depth is defined in **time**. To process long input sequences we need to build deep RNNs.\n",
